Description: Functions for simulating and estimating kinship-related dispersal.
    Assume an additive variance model of dispersal in two dimensions, as noted
    in Wright's work on isolation by distance and neighbournood sizes. Simple 
    and composite dispersal simulations are supplied, as well as the functions
    needed to estimate axial/intergenerational dispersal for simulated or 
    empirical data. For ease of use an integrated Shiny app is also included.
